Shock Intelligence Brief
Pakistan: Inflation-Led Macroeconomic Stress Transmission
1. Purpose of This System

This project develops a shock intelligence engine designed to identify inflationary shocks in Pakistan and trace how these shocks propagate through financial markets, liquidity conditions, and monetary policy responses over time.

Rather than focusing on forecasting, the system emphasizes detection, severity assessment, and transmission mapping of macroeconomic stress events using rolling statistical baselines.

2. Data Inputs

The engine integrates four core macro-financial indicators:

Consumer Price Index (CPI), monthly, as the primary shock origin

USD/PKR exchange rate, daily, as a market reaction indicator

3-Month KIBOR, daily, as a liquidity and funding stress indicator

Policy (Target) Rate, event-based, as the institutional response mechanism

All series are standardized, time-aligned, and stored in a unified relational schema.

3. Shock Detection Methodology

Shocks are identified using rolling statistical baselines. Deviations from historical norms are evaluated using z-score based thresholds, allowing the system to detect abnormal movements without assuming fixed regimes.

Each detected shock is assigned:

a deviation magnitude

a standardized z-score

a severity percentile relative to historical events

a persistence measure indicating how long stress remains elevated

4. Key Observations

The system identifies multiple high-severity inflation shocks across the sample period. These shocks are frequently followed by statistically significant responses in:

the exchange rate, often reacting rapidly and with high volatility

short-term interest rates, reflecting tightening liquidity conditions

Policy rate responses appear less frequent and more delayed, consistent with institutional decision-making processes rather than immediate market reactions.

The absence of policy action in certain periods is treated as an informative outcome rather than a system failure.

5. Interpretation and Limitations

The engine captures temporal stress transmission rather than causal inference. While the observed spillovers suggest meaningful economic relationships, the results should be interpreted as signals of coordinated stress rather than proof of direct causality.

Future extensions may include:

response timing attribution

regime-specific thresholds

machine learning-based pattern classification

6. Project Status

This shock brief represents a stable analytical milestone. The ingestion pipelines, detection logic, and spillover mechanisms are fully operational and reproducible.

Subsequent development will focus on interpretation, visualization, and advanced modeling layers.
