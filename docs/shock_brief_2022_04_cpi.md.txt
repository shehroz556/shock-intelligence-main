📄 Shock Brief — Pakistan Inflation Shock (April 2022)

System: Shock Intelligence Engine (Early Version)

Why this brief exists

This brief is an output of an ongoing project to build a data-driven, conservative system for detecting and interpreting macroeconomic shocks. The system is designed to identify when economic indicators behave in a statistically unusual way, and then evaluate the magnitude, duration, and downstream reactions of those events.

This document reflects an early but functional stage of that system.

Executive summary (plain language)

In April 2022, Pakistan experienced a statistically significant inflation shock, detected through an abrupt deviation in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) relative to recent historical behavior. The shock ranked as high severity compared to past inflation movements.

While the inflation shock itself showed limited persistence, subsequent data indicates a measurable reaction in the exchange rate, suggesting that inflationary pressure spilled into currency dynamics within a short time window.

No other cross-indicator reactions can be asserted at this stage.

What happened?

Using a rolling historical baseline adjusted for volatility, the April 2022 CPI reading deviated sharply from normal inflation behavior. This deviation exceeded the system’s detection threshold, triggering a formal shock event.

Importantly, the system does not rely on narratives or predefined events. The shock was identified purely because the data moved in an unusually large way over a short period of time.

How severe was the shock?

Severity is measured as the percentile rank of the shock’s deviation relative to historical CPI movements.

The April 2022 inflation shock ranks near the upper end of observed CPI deviations, indicating that it was not routine month-to-month variation, but a comparatively extreme inflationary movement.

Severity here reflects unusualness, not welfare impact directly, but unusually large movements are often where economic stress begins to propagate.

Did the shock persist?

Post-shock CPI readings did not remain consistently elevated relative to the pre-shock baseline for an extended number of periods. Based on available data, the shock appears to have behaved more like a sharp disturbance than an immediate structural break.

Persistence estimates are inherently forward-looking and will be updated as additional post-shock observations become available.

Did the shock spill over to other indicators?

After the inflation shock, the system evaluated whether other macro indicators exhibited abnormal behavior within a defined reaction window.

A statistically significant spillover into the PKR/USD exchange rate was detected. Exchange-rate movements following the CPI shock exceeded normal historical volatility, indicating that inflationary pressure was accompanied by short-term currency stress.

This spillover is temporal, not causal. The system does not claim that inflation caused the exchange-rate movement, only that the two were meaningfully linked in time beyond what historical volatility would predict.

No defensible spillovers into other indicators (such as equities or policy rates) can be asserted with current data.

What did not happen (and why this matters)

No evidence of broad multi-indicator macro stress

No detectable immediate policy-rate response

No confirmed equity-market overreaction

Explicitly stating non-events is important. Many economic narratives are formed by assuming reactions that data does not yet support.

Limitations and uncertainty

This brief is constrained by:

limited indicator coverage

sparse post-shock observations

absence of causal attribution

sensitivity to rolling window choices

These limitations reflect deliberate design choices favoring conservative inference over narrative completeness.

Why this matters going forward

This event serves as:

a reference inflation shock for future calibration

a demonstration of how inflation pressure can transmit into currency dynamics

a validation of the system’s ability to detect second-order effects when data becomes available

As more indicators and longer histories are added, this framework enables faster and more consistent interpretation of future macroeconomic disruptions.

About the system

Shocks are detected using rolling baselines and volatility-adjusted thresholds, explicitly avoiding lookahead bias. Severity, persistence, and spillovers are treated as separate analytical layers. The system is designed to remain conservative, auditable, and extensible.

Project status

This brief represents an early but meaningful milestone. The system is actively evolving, with planned extensions including additional indicators, automated data ingestion, and confidence scoring.
